## üßπ Key Highlights

- Cleaned and joined multiple datasets using **Pandas**
- Split names, removed duplicates, and handled missing values
- Applied conditional column creation (bonus, promotions, etc.)
- Aggregated and grouped data for insights (total project cost)
- Used **NumPy** for numerical operations and age calculations
